## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned a new technique to make fonts responsive using the clamp() function in CSS. It allows you to define a fluid font size that adapts between a minimum, a preferred value, and a maximum limit.

```css
.font {
    font-size: clamp(1rem, 2.5vw, 2rem);
}
```
